It took me a while to be able to make this blog happen.

First, I did it with wordpres, and it worked like a charm, but wordpress's clumsy and huge and hardly modifiable. So I wanted to change.

Through [oozled.com](http://oozled.com/resources/cms), I found jekyll, whose *"static website"* appealed to me because it meant something simple without a database. I'm no developer...

But I couldn't install Jekyll, thanks to a missing gem and some other stuff. But Octopress, a blog engine based on Jekyll, worked! 10 minutes and I was all set up.

How I did it :
---

First, create your `username.github.io` repository in github.
- Second, follow that :
[octopress: setup](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/)

- Third, follow that :
[octopress: deploying to github pages](http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/)

- Fourth :
[octopress: configuration](http://octopress.org/docs/configuring/)(almost nothing to do here!)

- and last :
[octopress: blogging basics](http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/), which will help you make a blog post.
